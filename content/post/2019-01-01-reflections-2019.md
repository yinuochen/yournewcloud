2018 has been such a tumultuous year for me. So much has happened, good and bad.

## Crypto

I invested in crypto in late 2017, and although I gained some profits, I lost most of it in 2018. Although, I have told myself multiple times that losing the money I invested in crypto is ok since this is just fun money, it still hurts when I saw thousands of dollars vanish. This taught me 3 important lessons.

First is not to be greedy. If you see yourself making a lot of money in a short amount of time, you need to question youself, why has this happened? Is it because of your efforts, real changes, or hype. If it is the third, you should immediately pull out your investment.

## Wife

My wife's fiance visa has finally been approved, and she came to live with me in the United States in June. This is such a big change for me since I have never lived with a girlfriend let alone a wife.

## Career

I changed jobs from more of a Technical Manager role to a DevOps Engineer working on Amazon Web Services (AWS). I had always wanted to change to a career focusing on the cloud, and I'm so joyful I could fulfill it in 2018.
