Hi, I'm a DevOps engineer working for Onica in Irvine, CA.

My goal is to share my cloud experiences to help others architect and find ideas to setup their own cloud infrastructure. Learning cloud was a major shift for me as I came from a traditional IT background with data centers and network switches/routers. I hope to bring the same transformation to other people and companies who needs it.

Other than working on the cloud, I like doing photography and traveling on my free time. Below is a picture of my work.
